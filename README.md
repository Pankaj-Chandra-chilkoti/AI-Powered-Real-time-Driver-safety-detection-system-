This project utilizes Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to real-time monitor driver behavior and detect unsafe actions such as distraction (e.g., phone use) and drowsiness (e.g., yawning, eye closure) and no seatbelt . It provides immediate alerts to enhance road safety and prevent accidents.
